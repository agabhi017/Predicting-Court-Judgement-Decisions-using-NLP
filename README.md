# Predicting-Court-Judgement-Decisions-using-Natural-Language-Processing

## Introduction
Legal institutions in most countries suffer from significant delay due to large
number of cases. This is not only an issue in law & ethics but a research problem which comes under the purview of legal engineering. With modern tools
and computational abilities we can look into using Natural Language Processing(NLP) as a guiding mechanism for legal systems and influence the productivity of our over-burdened courts.

## Case for India
The courts of india are relatively overburdened. The New Delhi’s High Court
(2009) observed that the existing backlog of cases would take another 466 years
to come to a verdict! The Hindu estimates the number of cases pending with
Indian courts to be around 30 million. The Law Commission, 1987, estimated
that there are 10 judges for every million population of India. With increasing
population the cases with the courts has increased drastically while the judge to
population ratio did not increase to the recommended level. All this together
stanches the flow of justice.
With state of the art Machine learning techniques in NLP our aim, is ’to accomplish human-like language processing’ (Elizabeth D. Liddy,2001.) As the applications of NLP continues it has accommodated many human-intensive work.
Machine Translation extends the data availability to everyone by breaking the
language barrier. As the financial markets are moving towards the algorithmic
trading, the analysis of plain text of news becomes important. Again, NLP
provides the tools to Extract Information from various sources which can then
be used to make trading choices. One most human-intensive work where the
NLP is penetrating is Question Answering. The focus remains on recognizing
the question, extracting the meaning and then provide the appropriate answer.
With AI shifting the problems of human-intensive functions towards machineintensive computations, its tools can be used to reduce the burden of the legal
courts by introduction of NLP based mechanisms in the system.
