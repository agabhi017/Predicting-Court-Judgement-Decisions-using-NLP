# Predicting Court Judgement Decisions using Natural Language Processing

## Introduction
Legal institutions in most countries suffer from significant delay due to large
number of cases. This is not only an issue in law & ethics but a research problem which comes under the purview of legal engineering. With modern tools
and computational abilities we can look into using Natural Language Processing(NLP) as a guiding mechanism for legal systems and influence the productivity of our over-burdened courts.

## Case for India
The courts of india are relatively overburdened. The New Delhiâ€™s High Court
(2009) observed that the existing backlog of cases would take another 466 years
to come to a verdict! The Hindu estimates the number of cases pending with
Indian courts to be around 30 million. The Law Commission, 1987, estimated
that there are 10 judges for every million population of India. With increasing
population the cases with the courts has increased drastically while the judge to
population ratio did not increase to the recommended level. All this together
stanches the flow of justice.


## Objective
Predicting the outcomes of cases which are under the jurisdiction of European
Court of Human Rights, regarding violations of Articles 3,5,6,8. Output will
be a binary vector of Violation and No violation.

## Data
  Article#  | Violations | Not Violations
----------- | ---------- | --------------
Article 3   | 591        | 560
Article 5   | 509        | 437
Article 6   | 754        | 565
Article 8   | 411        | 351
